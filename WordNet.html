<h1>A CommonLisp Interface to WordNet</h1>

<h2>About WordNet</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~geo/">Professor George Miller</a> of
the <a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/">Cognitive Science Laboratory</a>
of <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a> directed the development
a lexicographic database called <a href="http://clarity.princeton.edu:80/~wn/">WordNet</a>.

<p>
Princeton maintains a server by which the WordNet database can be 
<a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/w3wn.html">browsed</a>
via the World Wide Web.

<p>
The WordNet database is implemented as a set of 
<a href="ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/users/naha/WordNetdata-file-format.text">text files</a>.
<a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu:/people/naha/naha.html">Mark Nahabedian</a> (naha@ai.mit.edu)
has developed an interface to this database written in
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html">CommonLisp</a>.
This software provides an interface by which CommonLisp programs can access
lexicgraphic data from WordNet.


<h2>CommonLisp Interface</h2>
The interface is written in several layers:
<ul>
<li><a href="#base-layer">a base layer</a>
<li><a href="#record-extraction">record extraction</a>
<li><a href="#record-parsing">record parsing</a>
<li><a href="#data-representation">data representation</a>
<li><a href="#relation-hacking">pointer reasoning</a>
</ul>

<p>
There is also a simple
<a href="#browser">browser</a>
implemented in <a href="ftp://ftp.digitool.com/pub/clim/papers/">CLIM</a> for navigating the WordNet database.

<p>
This software represents parts of speech as lisp keyword symbols: <b>:noun</b>,
<b>:verb</b>, <b>:adjective</b> and <b>:adverb</b>.

<p>
The current version of this software only knows how to find WordNet index and
data files as they are named in the UNIX implementation of WordNet.  Set the
value of the parameter <b>wn::+wordnet-database-directory+</b> in the file
"wordnet-database-files.lisp" to the pathname of the directory where these files
can be found.

<p>
The current version has only been tested with Symbolics Genera and 
<a href="http://www.digitool.com/">Macintosh CommonLisp</a>
(thanks to Andrew Blumberg, blumberg@ai.mit.edu).  The software might require
slight modification to run on other Lisp Implementations.

<p>
All the files can be found
<a href="ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/users/naha/WordNet">here</a>.  A single file in UNIX 
<a href="ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/users/naha/WordNet/everything.tar">tar</a>
format is also available.

<a name="base-layer"><h3>The Base Layer</h3></a>

<p>
The base layer defines the packages and export lists for this software.  It is
implemented by these files:

<ul>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/users/naha/WordNetpackages.lisp">packages.lisp</a>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/users/naha/WordNetparts-of-speech.lisp">parts-of-speech.lisp</a>
</ul>



<a name="record-extraction"><h3>Record Extraction</h3></a>
The record extraction layer is the bottom-most one.  It implements
functions which extract records from the database files as text strings.

<dl>

<dt>(<b>index-entry-for-word</b> <i>file-description</i> <i>word</i>)
<dd>
Looks up <i>word</i> in the specified index file and returns the string
corresponding to that record of the index file.  The <i>file-description</i>
argument can either be a part of speech keyword, a pathname naming an index
file, or a stream which has been opened to that file.

<dt>(<b>read-data-file-entry</b> <i>file-description</i> <i>offset</i>)
<dd>
Reads a WordNet "symset" record from the specified <i>offset</i> in the specified
file.  A string is returned.  Offset was either read from an index record,
or from a pointer description in another synset record.  The <i>file-description</i> 
argument should identify a WordNet data file.  It should either be a part of speech 
keyword, a pathname, or a stream.

</dl>

<p>
This layer is implemented by the file
<a href="ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/users/naha/WordNetwordnet-database-files.lisp">wordnet-database-files.lisp</a>.

<p>
This layer depends on the files in the <a href="#base-layer">base layer</a>.



<a name="record-parsing"><h3>Record Parsing</h3></a>

The functions in this layer take strings as returned by the functions of the <a
href="#record-extraction">record extraction</a> layer.  They parse those strings
into components, returning them as multiple values.

<dl>

<dt>(<b>parse-index-file-entry</b> <i>entry</i>)
<dd>Parse the <i>entry</i> as returned by <b>index-entry-for-word</b>.  See the definition 
for a list of the values returned.

<dt>(<b>parse-data-file-entry</b> <i>entry</i>)
<dd>Parse the <i>entry</i> as returned by <b>read-data-file-entry</b>. See the definition 
for a list of the values returned.

</dl>

<p>
This layer is implemented by the file
<a href="ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/users/naha/WordNetparse-wordnet-data.lisp">parse-wordnet-data.lisp</a>.

<p>
This layer depends on the files in the <a href="#base-layer">base</a> layer.



<a name="data-representation"><h3>Data Representation</h3></a>

<p>
The data representation was chosen to parallel WordNet's own representation.  It
models index entries, synonym sets and pointers.  Depending on ones application,
there might well be more useful ways to represent the WordNet lexicon.  Practice
might lead us to modify this representation or develop a new one.

<dl>

<dt>Class <b>wn:wordnet-index-entry</b>
<dd>
Objects of this class are used to represent entries read from the index files.
They are created and returned by the function <b>wn:cached-index-lookup</b>.

<dt>(<b>wn:cached-index-lookup</b> <i>word</i> <i>part-of-speech</i>)
<dd>
Looks up <i>word</i> in the index file corresponding to <i>part-of-speech</i> 
and returns an index entry object for it.

<dt>(<b>wn:index-entry-synsets</b> <i>index-entry</i>)
<dd>Returns a list of the synonym sets, as <b>wn:wordnet-synset-entry</b> objects, 
which <i>index-entry</i> refers to.

<dt> Class <b>wn:wordnet-synset-entry</b>
<dd>
Objects of this class represent synonym sets.  There is a subclass for each part
of speech:
<ul>
<li><b>wn:wordnet-noun-entry</b>
<li><b>wn:wordnet-adjective-entry</b>
<li><b>wn:wordnet-adverb-entry</b>
<li><b>wn:wordnet-verb-entry</b>
</ul>

<dt>(<b>wn:synset-words</b> <i>synset</i>)
<dd>
Returns a list of "words" that are in the synonym set <i>synset</i>.  Each word 
is represented by a list, the first element of which is the word as a string. The
second element is the sense number assigned by the lexicographer.
								
<dt>(<b>wn:wordnet-pointers</b> <i>synset</i>)
<dd>
Returns a list of the wordnet pointers from the specified <i>synset</i>.

<dt>Class <b>wn:wordnet-pointer</b>
<dd>
These are how wordnet pointers are represented.

<dt>(<b>wn:wordnet-pointer-type</b> <i>pointer</i>)
<dd>
Returns the wordnet pointer type for <i>pointer</i>, e.g. <b>:antonym</b>,
<b>:hypernym</b>, <b>:entailment</b>, etc.

<dt>(<b>wordnet-pointer-from-synset</b> <i>pointer</i>)
<dd>
Returns the synonym set which <i>pointer</i> points from.

<dt>(<b>wordnet-pointer-to-synset</b> <i>pointer</i>)
<dd>
Returns the synonym set which <i>pointer</i> points to.

<dt>(<b>wordnet-pointer-from-word</b> <i>pointer</i>)
(<b>wordnet-pointer-to-word</b> <i>pointer</i>)
<dd>
If <i>pointer</i> refers to a specific word in the synonym set, that word (as a
list of string and sense number) are returned, otherwise the synonym set is
returned.

</dl>

<p>
This layer is implemented by the file
<a href="ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/users/naha/WordNetrepresentation.lisp">representation.lisp</a>.

<p>
This layer depends on the files in the <a href="#base-layer">base</a> layer,
the <a href="#record-extraction">record extraction</a> layer
and the <a href="#record-parsing">record parsing</a> layer.



<a name="relation-hacking"><h3>Pointer Reasoning</h3></a>

<p>
This layer provides some functions for operating on the graph formed by WordNet
synonym sets and the pointer relationships among them.  Here follows a
description of the operations currently provided.  This set is expected to grow
with time.

<dl>

<dt>(<b>wn:relation-transitive-closure</b> <i>synset</i> <i>relation-type</i>)
<dd>
<i>relation-type</i> must be a WordNet pointer type representing a transitive relation.
This function returns a set which is the transitive closure of that relation starting
with <i>synset</i>.  The closure set is returned as a list.  Each element of the list 
is a cons whose <b>car</b> is a synset object and whose <b>cdr</b> is an integer 
rpresenting the distance along the <i>relation-type</i> between this synset
and <i>synset</i>.

<dt>(<b>wn:commonality</b> <i>relation-type</i> &rest <i>synsets</i>)
<dd>
Finds the common "ancestors" of the synset objects in <i>synsets</i> along the
<i>relation-type</i> graph.  It returns a list, the first element of which is the closest
common ancestor.  The rest of the list has one element for each of <i>synsets</i>.  Each 
element is a cons whose <b>car</b> is one of the <i>synsets</i> and whose <b>cdr</b>
is the distance from this synset to the common ancestor.

</dl>

<p>
This Layer is implemented by the file
<a href="ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/users/naha/WordNetrelationship-algorithms.lisp">relationship-algorithms.lisp</a>.
<p>
This layer depends on the <a href="#data-representation">data representation</a> layer.


<a name="browser"><h3>Browser</h3></a>

<p>
The browser provides a simple user interface for examining the wordnet database.
It defines CLIM presentation types and commands for displaying the objects
defined in the <a href="#data-representation">data representation</a> layer.

<p>
It depends on the
<a href="#data-representation">data representation</a> layer, and on the 
layers on which that layer depends.

<p>
The browser also depends on a domonstration lisp interactor implemented in
CLIM, which in the Symbolics Genera CLIM distribution can be found in the directory
"sys>clim>rel-2>demo>listener.lisp".

<p>
The command <b>:Lookup</b> takes a string as argument.  It looks up that string
in the indices and prints out a list of index entries that were found.

<p>
You can click on one of these index entries to get a list of the synonym sets
that it refers to.

<p>
Clicking on a synonym set will list the pointer references that it has to other
synsets.  The presentation of the pointer includes a presentation of the synset
that it points to.  You can click in it in turn to see its pointers.



<a name="examples"><h3>Examples</h3></a>

<p>
Some 
<a href="ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/users/naha/WordNet/examples.lisp">
examples</a>
have been written which illustrate the use of this software.  Included 
are functions which list synonyms and antonyms for a specified word, and a 
function which lists the names and nicknames of the U.S. States.

There is also a function which tries to identify the synset for a word having a
sense most similar to a specified word by comparing distances along hypernym
pointers among the synsets for the word being looked up and the sense indicating
word.
